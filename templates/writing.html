    <p>
      I aim to post at least one piece per week. Most of my work and study
      right now involves Python, but there will be the occasional
      JavaScript or CSS article, too. If you spot any errors, please let
      me know!

    {# 26/08/20 #}
    <p>
      Two string methods from Python's standard library,
      <code>str.startswith(<span class="code-italic">prefix</span>)</code>
      and
      <code>str.endswith(<span class="code-italic">suffix</span>)</code>,
      are regularly featured in tutorials, but they have a very useful
      ability that isn't often mentioned. The
      <span class="code-italic">prefix</span> and
      <span class="code-italic">suffix</span> arguments can be tuples,
      lending a regex-like functionality to both.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, say I'm working on a genealogy project, and want to
      extract all names with surname 'McMillan' or 'Harris'. I can easily
      pass a tuple argument like so:

    <h2 class="sub-heading">100 Days of Code</h2>
  </section>
  <p>Last week, I started Talk Python's '100 Days of Code in Python' programme. The thinking behind it, as the title
    suggests, is that students code for 100 days straight, backed-up by near-daily video tutorials on a wide range of
    subjects. I say near-daily, because every few days there's a 'free' coding day, where the objective is to build
    something using the topics covered in the most recent block of tutorials.</p>
  <p>Before starting, I was already pretty conscientious about coding at least a little bit every day. But this provides
    more structure right now, which I can use, and — even more important — compels me to build! These projects are
    often small, but I'm less concerned with that right now than I am with getting into the habit of producing.</p>
  <p>I'll be writing (and Tweeting!) a lot about what I'm doing with this course and, of course, posting links to and descriptions of
    the projects I build. Early days, but I'm excited to see where this goes. From my perspective, it's pitched at an
    intermediate level, so I'm looking forward to pushing myself as it proceeds.</p>
  <p>Which reminds me... One of the things I need to address with this 'Writing' section is to make it more of an actual,
    working blog. Right now, with just a few pieces of content, it's fine to simply 'plug in' some articles with
    straight HTML. As it grows, though, tagged, date-stamped, entries would be far preferable, so that's where it'll go
    next.
    This is a Flask site, so adding a Flask-based blog is reasonably straightforward.</p>

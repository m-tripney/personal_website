  <section id="hello">
    <h1 class="page-headline">Hello</h1>
    <p>My name is <span class="para-highlight">Mark Tripney,</span> and I'm looking for work as a <span
        class="para-highlight">Python developer</span>. I studied Archaeology (University of York, England), then
      Architectural Conservation (Edinburgh College of Art, Scotland). I worked in academia for a number of years, and
      always had a keen interest in design and the <span class="para-highlight">crafting of things</span>. That
      interest is now focused on Python, and the ways in which it can be applied to <span class="para-highlight">positive, creative endeavours</span>.
    </p>
    <p>I am comfortable writing <span class="para-highlight">HTML</span>, <span class="para-highlight">CSS</span>, and
      <span class="para-highlight">JavaScript</span>. This site was built in <span class="para-highlight">Flask</span>,
      and I have a fair understanding of <span class="para-highlight">Django</span>. In fact, there's a Django project
      making its way to the <span class="para-highlight">Work</span> section soon!</p>

  <section id="work-overview">
    <h1 class="work-headline">Work</h1>
    <p>In building a <span class="para-highlight">portfolio</span>, I necessarily began with some quite simple projects,
      progressing to more advanced ones
      as I felt capable. The collection is being <span class="para-highlight">regularly updated</span>, and I'm working
      towards a keystone project this summer/autumn (2020). For now, view a range of JavaScript and Python projects <a
          href="{{ url_for('work') }}">here</a>.</p>

  <section id="writing-overview">
    <h1 class="writing-headline">Writing</h1>
    <p>I enjoy writing about web design, web development, and (most of all) Python. <span class="para-highlight">I love the process</span>,
      and I've found that, alongside writing code, it's the best way for me to <span class="para-highlight">reinforce my learning</span>.
      Some of these pieces are short and tightly-focused &mdash; an exploration of a particular language feature, for
      example &mdash; while others are longer, more subjective thoughts on trends or developments. You can find them
      all <a href="{{ url_for('writing') }}">here</a>.</p>

  <section id="contact">
    <h1 class="contact-headline">Contact</h1>
    <p>I'd love to hear from you! I'm happy to discuss any position, either <span
        class="para-highlight">full-time</span> or <span class="para-highlight">part-time</span>, <span
        class="para-highlight">remote</span> or <span class="para-highlight">on-site</span> (I'm based in Brussels,
      Belgium).</p>
